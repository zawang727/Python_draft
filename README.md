# Python_electron_spectrom_simulator

The main file is 3D_homo_magnetic_electron_spectrometer.py (Though it called homo, but it can support heterogeneous magnetic field now : ) )
The calculation is done by Lorentz force equation with relativistic theory. The calculation method is update the momentum, velocity and position in very small time step
The plot tool is in the plot tool file for illustration
